# Best Practices

This is a collection of best practices and conventions to follow with this project

## PR Checklist

- Your code builds clean without any errors or warnings
- You are happy with your implementation, would you pass it?
- You have adhered to agency coding standards
- You have pulled the most recent develop branch
- You have created unit tests where appropriate
- You have tested your implementation and can’t find any bugs
- You have run the project units test and they pass
- You have added documentation to the project wiki on how to use any new features

## Coding standards

- Keep the components simple as possible
- Keep code organised and tidy
- Keep code dry
- Split code into manageable chunks
- Deconstruct Objects & Functions
- All content must come from the API

```tsx
export const ComponentName = ({
  variant,
  modifiers,
  prop1,
  prop2,
  prop3,
  tag,
  ...rest
}: ComponentNameProps) => {
    // functions

    return ()
}
```

## Folder Structure

This is the structure for the components within components folder.

```
Component-name
  |-- Component-name.component.tsx
  |-- Component-name.types.ts
  |-- Component-name.module.scss
  |-- Component-name.stories.tsx
  |-- Component-name.stories.mdx
  |-- Component-name.test.tsx
```

## Css Modules

The project makes use of CSS modules. The decision was taken to move away from styled components due to performance issues and problems with FOUC (flash of un-styled content).

The projects modules where possible are written in BEM structure for familiarity.

Css modules allows styles to be included using dot notation within the components. However due to using BEM we lose the Element and Modifier identifiers using dot notation.

For ease of development and aligning the styles we use CSS modules this way:

```tsx
import cs from "classnames";
import styles from "./Component-name.module.css";

export const ComponentName = ({
  variant,
  modifiers,
  ...rest
}: ComponentNameProps) => {
  // functions

  return (
    <div
      className={cs(
        styles["component-block"],
        styles["component-block--modifier"]
      )}
    >
      <span className={styles["component-block__element"]}>/* content */</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

It is important to note that we use the `classnames` package as a way of joining the classes together.
