# Architecture

In the context of coding and component-based architecture, the terms "atom," "partial,", "component" and "layout" are often used to describe different levels of abstraction and reusability within a webpage / web-app.

1. Atoms

**Definition:**

The most basic building blocks of your UI. In a React app, atoms can be individual HTML elements (or very simple React components) like buttons, input fields, labels, icons, and typography elements.

**Key Points:**

- Reusability: Atoms are designed to be reused across the app.
- Simplicity: They are not broken down further; they provide the foundational elements.
- Consistency: Using a well-defined set of atoms ensures a consistent look and feel.

**Example:**

A `<Button>` component that encapsulates styling and basic behavior can be an atom. It might accept props such as size, color, or disabled to adjust its appearance.

## Atom:

Is the smallest and most basic building block in a design system or component library.
It represents a simple and often reusable UI element, like a button, input field, or icon.

Atoms are typically not composed of other UI elements.

A button, a text input, or an icon can be considered atoms.

## 2. Components (Molecules & Organisms):

Is a high-level, self-contained building block that encapsulates a specific functionality or feature.

Components can be composed of atoms, partials, and other components, forming a hierarchy of abstraction.
They are often reusable and modular, making it easy to maintain and scale a codebase.

A form component that includes text inputs (atoms), buttons (atoms), and labels (atoms) could be considered a component.

## Layout:

A layout is the arrangement and positioning of components within a specific section of a user interface or an entire page.

It defines the overall structure and organisation of the UI.

A page layout might include a header component, a sidebar component, and a main content component arranged in a specific way to create the overall structure of a webpage / web app.

## Foundations - Design Tokens

What They Are:

Variables, colors, typography settings, spacing values, and other style constants are often referred to as design tokens. They serve as the foundational elements or “DNA” of your design system.

Purpose:

Consistency: Ensures a uniform look and feel across all UI components.
Maintainability: Changing a variable (like a primary color) in one place updates the design everywhere it’s used.
Scalability: Facilitates theming and customization, allowing you to adapt your UI for different brands or modes (e.g., dark mode).

Implementing Atomic Design in React
When building your React framework with Atomic Design:

Organize Your Project Structure:
Create directories for atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This helps in maintaining a clear hierarchy and makes it easier to locate and reuse components.

Focus on Reusability:
Ensure that each atom and component is as generic as possible. Use props to customize behavior and appearance, so they can adapt to different contexts.

Encapsulate Styles and Behavior:
Use CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, or your preferred styling strategy to keep styles modular and scoped to individual components.

Test at Multiple Levels:
Write unit tests for atoms and molecules and integration tests for organisms and layouts to ensure that your UI remains consistent and bug-free as it scales.

Layouts (Templates & Pages)
Definition:
Layouts represent the overall structure and composition of the UI. They provide context for where and how your components are arranged on a page.

Templates: Define the page structure by positioning organisms and components in a layout without real content.
Pages: Concrete instances of templates filled with actual content. They are used for testing the design with real data and fine-tuning the UI.
Key Points:

Structure: Layouts organize the placement and relationship of components to create a coherent and responsive interface.
Responsiveness: They handle how components adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
Context: Layouts provide the overall context that ties individual components together into a full UI experience.
Examples:

Template: A blog page layout that includes a header, sidebar, and main content area, where each area is a placeholder for more complex components.
Page: A fully rendered blog page with actual articles, images, and navigation items populated within the template structure.
