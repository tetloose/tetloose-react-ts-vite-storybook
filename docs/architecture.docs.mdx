# Architecture

In the context of coding and component-based architecture, the terms "Foundation", "atom", "component" and "layout" are often used to describe different levels of abstraction and reusability within a webpage / web-app.

## Foundations - (Design Tokens):

### What They Are:

Variables, colors, typography settings, spacing values, and other style constants are often referred to as design tokens. They serve as the foundational elements or “DNA” of your design system.

### Purpose:

- **Consistency:** Ensures a uniform look and feel across all UI components.
- **Maintainability:** Changing a variable (like a primary color) in one place updates the design everywhere it’s used.
Scalability: Facilitates theming and customization, allowing you to adapt your UI for different brands or modes (e.g., dark mode).

## Atoms:

### What They Are:

The most basic building blocks of your UI. In a React app, atoms can be individual HTML elements (or very simple React components) like buttons, input fields, labels, icons, and typography elements.

### Purpose:

- **Reusability:** Atoms are designed to be reused across the app.
- **Simplicity:** They are not broken down further; they provide the foundational elements.
- **Consistency:** Using a well-defined set of atoms ensures a consistent look and feel.

## 2. Components - (Molecules & Organisms):

### What They Are:

High-level, self-contained building block that encapsulates a specific functionality or feature.

Components can be composed of Foundations, Atoms, and other components, forming a hierarchy of abstraction.

They are often reusable and modular, making it easy to maintain and scale a codebase.

## Layouts (Templates & Pages)

### Definition:

Layouts represent the overall structure and composition of the UI. They provide context for where and how your components are arranged on a page. At this point you should just be piecing together **Components** into a desired **layout**. It's ok to write some functional code here, but keep it to a minimal, as functional code will happen at the **Component** level

### Templates:

Define the page structure by positioning **atoms** and **components** in a layout without real content, although you can pass down content as props here.

Concrete instances of templates filled with actual content. They are used for testing the design with real data and fine-tuning the UI.

### Key Points:

- Structure: Layouts organize the placement and relationship of components to create a coherent and responsive interface.
- Responsiveness: They handle how components adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
- Context: Layouts provide the overall context that ties individual components together into a full UI experience.

### Examples:

Layout: A blog page layout that includes a header, sidebar, and main content area, where each area is a placeholder for more complex components.
Page: A fully rendered blog page with actual articles, images, and navigation items populated within the template structure.

## Implementing Atomic Design in React

When building your React framework with Atomic Design:

### Organize Your Project Structure:

Create directories for **foundations**, **atoms**, **components** and **layouts**. This helps in maintaining a clear hierarchy and makes it easier to locate and reuse components.

### Focus on Reusability:

Ensure that each **atom** and **component** is as **generic** as possible. Use props to customize behavior and appearance, so they can adapt to different contexts.

### Encapsulate Styles and Behavior:

Use **CSS-in-JS**, **CSS modules**, or your preferred styling strategy to keep styles modular and scoped to individual components.

### Test at Multiple Levels:

Write unit tests for **foundations**, **atoms** and **components** and integration tests for layouts to ensure that your UI remains consistent and bug-free as it scales.
