<Meta title="Documentation/Update Icons" />

# Introduction

The icons are located in `src/icons/*/` and they were added using [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/), an SVG icon library.

# How to update

1. Go to [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) and load the `selection.json`
2. Sometimes icons have background colors. Click the icon, deselect the background color, and align it with the grid. Give it a readable name; Figma often names them oddly.
3. Once the icons are updated, select them in the pack using the icons at the top. Then, click the "Generate Font" button at the bottom right to download the font.
4. Replace icon `ttf / svg / woff` and `selection.json` in `src/icons`
5. Copy the new class names from the stylesheet they give you, to `src/styles/global/icons.scss`
