# Icon

The **Icon** component is a flexible visual element that renders an icon using a native `<i>` element. It supports customisable sizes, colours, and additional modifiers for further styling. The icon to display is determined by the `name` prop.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@foundations/Icon/Icon.component'
```

```tsx
  <Icon
    name={'happy'}
    color={'dark'}
    size={'sml'}
  />
```

### modifiers

- Type: `string[]`
- Default: `[]`
- Description: Additional CSS classes for custom styling, appended to the component's base classes.

### name

- Type: `IconNames ('happy' | 'angry')`
- Default: None
- Description: Specifies the icon to be rendered. The component uses this prop to determine which icon style to display.

### size

- Type: `string`
- Default: 'med'
- Description: Determines the size of the icon. The default size is 'med', but other sizes can be applied via CSS classes.

### color

- Type: `string`
- Default: None
- Description: Applies a colour styling to the icon. This prop corresponds to a CSS class that sets the icon colour.

### ...rest

- Type: `Additional native HTML attributes for the <i> element.`
- Default: None
- Description: Any extra attributes provided will be passed to the underlying `<i>` element, allowing further customisation.

# How to update

The icons are located in `public/assets/icons`.

1. Go to [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) and load the `public/assets/icons/selection.json`
2. Sometimes icons have background colors. Click the icon, deselect the background color, and align it with the grid. Give it a readable name; Figma often names them oddly.
3. Once the icons are updated, select them in the pack using the icons at the top. Then, click the "Generate Font" button at the bottom right to download the font.
4. Replace icon `ttf / svg / woff` and `selection.json` in `public/assets/icons`
5. Copy the new class names from the stylesheet they give you, to `src/foundations/Icon/Icon.module.scss`
6. Remove any left over files from zip
