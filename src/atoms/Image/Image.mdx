# Image

The **Image** component is a custom image component that uses `LazyLoadImage` to render images with lazy loading and responsive behaviour. It supports breakpoints for image size, ratio, and position, along with different source options for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. A placeholder image and blur effect can also be applied for a smoother user experience.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Image } from '@atoms/Image/Image.component'
```

```tsx
import Desktop from '@images/test/desktop.jpg'
import Tablet from '@images/test/tablet.jpg'
import Mobile from '@images/test/mobile.jpg'
import Placeholder from '@images/test/placeholder.jpg'
```

```tsx
<Image
  modifiers={['custom-class']}
  src={Desktop} // this overrides desktop, tablet and mobile
  desktop={Desktop}
  tablet={Tablet}
  mobile={Mobile}
  placeholder={Placeholder}
  width={600}

  ratio={{ default: '16x9' }}
  position={{ default: 'center-bottom' }}
  size={{ default: 'cover' }}
